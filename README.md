# Integrating the CARLA Autonomous Car Simulator with the ROTRA Highway Code tool

## Description

This project is designed to showcase the interaction between the ROTR agent and the Carla server using SWI-Prolog. The ROTR agent performs actions based observations of the surrounding world, transfomed into beliefs and intention, received from the Prolog server.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have the following software installed:

- Carla server: Download and install the Carla server from [Carla's official website](https://carla.org/).
- SWI-Prolog: Download and install SWI-Prolog from [SWI-Prolog's official website](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Start the Carla server by following the instructions provided in the Carla documentation.
3. Run the `server.pl` file located in the server folder to start the Prolog server.
4. Execute the ROTR agent to initiate the interaction with the Carla server and Prolog server.

## Usage

Once you have set up the prerequisites and followed the getting started steps, you can use the ROTR agent to interact with the Carla server. The agent will receive instructions from the Prolog server and perform the corresponding actions in the Carla environment.
